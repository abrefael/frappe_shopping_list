## Frappe Shopping List

Allows you to go buy stuff at the market and mark what you got.
You can change the color scheme by creating the following files in your:


**_FRAPPEBENCHROOT_**/sites/**_YOURSITENAME_**/public/files/

```
input-with-feedback
btn
form-page
grid-footer
container
grid-row
grid-heading-row
```
and write a color code in each of them. each of these files controls a different part of the shopping list screen.


HINT: When using a smart phone browser, you don't see all the parts of the screen anyway. ;-)
